Spatio-Temporal Classification of üèÄ  Basketball Actions using 3D-CNN Models on the SpaceJam Dataset.

## Motivation
Utilizing the SpaceJam Basketball Action Dataset [Repo](https://github.com/simonefrancia/SpaceJam), I want to predict a given action for each of the players tracked within a video.

This is a demo video from the SpaceJam Repo
